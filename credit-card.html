                     <p class="p-3">Cash is slowly becoming a thing of the past in a majority of countries including Australia. This shift has made it more convenient than ever to make payments. More recently, there has been the adoption of contactless card payments, but with it comes growing concerns around security. So how do card payments work? And how secure is your information?
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Credit cards work as electronic storage devices, holding the specific banking information required to make a transaction. The original credit cards worked using a magnetic strip on the back which you would swipe at the payment machine. This magnetic strip works very similarly to a cassette tape with tracks of information for bank information such as account number, expiration date, security codes as well as a Card Verification Value (PIN number). Data stored on this magnetic strip is unprotected and never changes. When a credit card is swiped through a reader, the information on this magnetic strip is transmitted to a company which collects the payment request, verifies the request and guarantees payment to the merchant.&nbsp;</span><br></p>

                     <p class="p-3">This method of payment has since been phased out due to its lack of security. This form of technology is long outdated and leaves customer data vulnerable. The problem with magnetic strips lies with the static nature of this data. This information never changes, making it easy for fraudsters to lift information off a card and clone it onto a new card. This vulnerability has since been addressed with the adoption of EMV chip cards. &nbsp;
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) is a set of specifications for smart card payments and acceptance devices. Utilising this form of payment involves inserting your card into the bottom of card reader, with the card remaining inserted during the transaction. These chip cards incorporate an extra layer of security through the use of a computer chip and encryption to store and protect customer data. In addition to this comes the new set of specifications and guidelines for banks to follow. In using this system, the customer will insert heir card into a compatible EMV terminal. Once inserted, the chip produces a dynamic one-time use code for the current transaction. The cardholder’s information is protected by cryptographic keys and the dynamic key, making duplicating of the card extremely difficult.</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3">This standard has been adopted in over 130+ countries with approximately 2.4 billion EMV chip cards in circulation and 36.9 million terminals. Although better than magnetic strip cards, there are still potential security risks associated with chip cards. In many parts of the world (such as the US), payments are currently validated through signature as opposed to a pin code. This vulnerability is slowly being addressed with standards in other countries adopting PIN validation. Another potential security risk can occur if a store doesn’t have an EMV terminal. Current cards include a magnetic strip for use on traditional terminals, which if required, won’t provide the added layer of security to your transactions.
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>EMV cards have been implemented in Australia since April 2013 and have since been widely phased out in favour of contactless payment. Australia is currently leading the world in contactless payments, with 325.4 million contactless payments made in 2017. Although widely adopted here, other countries have been slower to follow. Only an estimated 3% of cards in the US are contactless, with a lot of scepticism around the security behind it. So how does contactless payment work? And how does it compare to existing standards in cashless payment?&nbsp;</span></p>

<br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Contactless payments aim to make payments easier and quicker, allowing customers to simply hold their card up to a terminal to make a transaction. This system uses short-range wireless technology, utilising near-field communication (NFC) antennas to transmit the data associated with a transaction. This type of technology is also widely used in transport systems with the adoption of Opal cards. Much like EMV chips, contactless payment also uses dynamic data for each individual transaction, maintaining this same encryption with a slightly different data transmission method. &nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3">Some common myths around contactless payment include thieves electronically pickpocketing card details or skimming your details to create a counterfeit card. These events are far less feasible than some believe. EMV machines need to be registered with a payment vendor and linked to a bank account, making these machines difficult to acquire and easy to track. Furthermore, the NFC signal reach of contactless cards is quite small (less than 2.5 cm), making it extremely unlikely for a transaction to be made through a pocket. The added dynamic data encryption also makes card copying difficult.
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Although these common concerns pose far less of risk than people might expect, contactless cards are still far from perfect. Even with equivalent encryption standards as chip cards, the adoption of tap-and-go payments have attributed to a surge in credit card fraud in Australia.&nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3">The main issue arises from the lack of PIN authentication for payments under $100. This issue could be remedied by reducing this payment limit like other parts of the world (limit is set to $25 in the US). This would sacrifice a small level of convenience for added security. Other options could include cutting off a card after a certain number of transactions. These issues are currently being discussed by banks and financial institutions alongside law enforcement.
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Ultimately, there will never be a perfect payment system, and so there will always be a responsibility for customers to take charge of their own security. Prevent outsiders from overseeing your PIN of card information, do not flash it around, be careful when downloading an app to your smartphone, install an antivirus, enable SMS notifications at your bank and alert your bank as soon as you spot suspicious activity. <br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Other precautions users can take include using RFID proof wallets or card sleeves. Turning to mobile payment methods such as Apple and Android pay can also increase your own protection. These apps don’t store your actual credit card details but instead use tokenisation which replaces your information with unique symbols, retaining all the essential information without compromising its security. These apps apply tokenisation to produce unique codes for each transaction and also use biometric authentication for all payments, ultimately adding increased protection during transactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
