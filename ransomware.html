                     <p class="p-3">Ransomware is defined by the US Department of Homeland Security as a “type of malicious software, or malware, designed to deny access to a computer system of data until a ransom is paid.” Ransomware is typically spread through phishing emails or visiting an infected website. Once the ransomware has been downloaded, it takes over the victim’s computer, most commonly by encrypting user files. The three main types of ransomware are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SCAREWARE</strong>- This comes in the form of rogue security software and tech support scams. These commonly involved receiving pop-up messages claiming that malware was discovered, and the only way to get rid of it is to pay. The consequences of ignoring these messages will most likely result in very little, with no harm to your computer system.</li>
                    <li><strong>SCREEN LOCKERS</strong> - Lock-screen ransomware freezes the user out of their computer. A standard experience of a lock screen ransomware will feature a full-size window featuring some official seal of the FBI or US Department of Justice, claiming the detection of illegal activity and the paying of a fine.</li>
                    <li><strong>ENCRYPTING RANSOMWARE</strong> - This is the most severe ransomware, encrypting files and demanding payment for restoration. This is the most consequential type of ransomware as it is almost impossible to restore your files any other way. With these encryptions, there is no way to decrypt your files without a key known only to the attacker. And with the global adoption of computers, the files we store on our computers have become increasingly more important. With many ransomwares, even after paying, there is no guarantee your files will be returned.&nbsp;</li>

                     <p class="p-3"><strong>The Growing Threat
<br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ransomware has become the fastest growing cyber threat as a result of the simplicity to create and distribute. According to the Department of Justice, an average of 4000 ransomware attacks occurred per day in 2016 in the US. While a majority of these occur on a smaller scale, these ransomware attacks can sometimes target large government organisations and have tremendous impacts. This can be seen directly with the recent ransomware attacks in Baltimore, Maryland.&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Earlier this year, on May 7, hackers targeted Baltimore using a ransomware known as RobbinHood. This attack crippled online government services and encrypted government servers. As a result, government emails went down, online payments to city departments couldn’t be made and housing transactions couldn’t be processed.&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>The hackers demanded for 13 bitcoins (around $76,000) to free their files, a sum which was not met by city officials. The city contracted a series of experts to assist in restoring services, with mayor Jack Young warning it could take months to recover some systems. Access to online services have slowly been restored with 70% of city employee email accounts active as of June 12. The fallout from the attack is still ongoing, with issues producing and mailing water bills. Young has estimated the ongoing damage to be over $18 million, including “$8 million lost because of deferred or lost revenue while the city was unable to process payments”. This figure could ultimately rise as the city continues to pay for cybersecurity experts to reinforce their systems in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3"><strong>Addressing the Greater Issue
<br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Although the impacts felt by Baltimore were severe, the ransomware attacks on Baltimore are by no means an outlier in a growing trend in cybercrime. Last year, Atlanta spent $2.6 million recovering from an attack, with attacks previously also targeting Dallas and Birmingham. There are also places that pay out the ransom, with Riviera Beach, Florida recently paying $600,000 in an attempt to retrieve their records. As of writing, no data has been recovered yet. Jackson County, Georgia also payed out $400,000 to attackers in March 2019, a move that paid off in regaining control. Amongst these examples, more than 50 US cities have been victims of attacks within the past 2 years alone.&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Amidst these attacks, there has been a growing debate about paying or not paying the ransom. Beyond the ethical concerns associated with rewarding criminals with taxpayer money comes a larger underlying argument. If cities collectively stop providing these rewards, the incentive for hackers will disappear. Every dollar turned over to cybercriminals actively encourages them to continue attacking. &nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>So how do we enact these changes? Pass laws barring ransomware payments. Alongside this prohibition, funds should also be devoted to assisting cities in increasing security. Set up task forces under the Department of Homeland Security to help municipalities recover from attacks and enforce the need to backup critical data. Although these steps are drastic and will take time to be effective, it will be a necessary long term investment to a growing issue.&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Ultimately, until these dramatic solutions can be implemented, the only real response to the problem comes as a more proactive approach to system security. With many of these small municipalities running on outdated computer systems, it may be time for city officials to consider an upgrade.&nbsp;</span></p>
