                     <p class="p-3">Software piracy is defined as the unauthorized duplication of software in a manner that violates the copyright. The ease of access to technology has meant that over the years, software piracy has grown rapidly. In our current digital ecosystem, some of the most common content facing these issues include games, operating systems and productivity software such as the Adobe suite. Software piracy is a worldwide problem, with more than $11 billion lost to piracy every year. Due to the value of software, as well as the easy nature of copying, software piracy can be hard to combat. In this ongoing effort, one term that always comes up is DRM.</p>

                     <p class="p-3">Digital rights management (DRM) is a broad term that refers to any system that controls access to copyrighted material using technological means. This encompasses a variety of methods and applications which ultimately removes control of usage from the user, putting control in the hands of a computer program. This additional software works to prevent users from mishandling the usage of a product.&nbsp;<br><br>DRM has been a prominent component of software for the last 30 years, along with an ongoing debate about its effectiveness and value. At the forefront of this debate is the video game industry. Currently today, the video game market is valued at over $93 billion. In 2014 alone, total revenue lost due to pirated games was approximately $74 billion and almost 2.5 billion pirated games were downloaded. Over the history of video games, there have been various physical and digital protections in place to prevent piracy.<br><br>In the early days of video games, video game consoles dominated the market. Some notable examples of DRM can be seen in the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) from 1983. Nintendo initially used proprietary cartridges, rather than more commonly available formats (like floppy disks), creating a form of physical copy protection. This made the copying of games very difficult for the average person.&nbsp;</p>

                     <p class="p-3">A similar approach to DRM can be seen with the PlayStation 1 (PS1). Around the release of the PS1, came the widespread adoption of the CD-ROM. With the use of this standardized format, there was no way to employ the same security techniques as cartridge-based systems. Sony instead utilized a special watermark on their CDs, making them distinguishable from conventional CDs. This watermark contained the regional code of the CD and was specially manufactured through pressing the watermark onto the disk. When the PS1 read this watermark, it compared the regional code to the one on the internal system. This prevented games from other regions to be played, but also prevented unlicensed copies of the game to be made as the watermark was nearly impossible for consumers to imitate.<br><br>With the shift into the modern era, PC gaming has become increasingly prevalent. With this shift, along with the widespread adoption of internet distribution, the nature of DRMs have changed. Most protections come in the form of product keys, watermarking or through game hosting software. Product keys are a useful method to validate purchases by consumers and are generally quite effective in preventing average consumers from copying these programs. An interesting example of this is with Microsoft Windows. Microsoft currently allows consumers to install Windows without the requirement to purchase anything. Users are then prompted to enter a product key to activate their version. Users that do not activate Windows are still granted the core functionalities of the operating system with the only caveat being a watermark in the bottom right corner of the screen, as well as the restriction on some customizability within settings.</p>

                     <p class="p-3">The other main form of DRM is in the form of product software. A key example of this is Steam, an online platform that distributes games. Steam has its DRM solution integrated into their game launcher, a solution that is mostly done well. Players can purchase games through their account and are then granted access to play these games through Steam which acts as a game launcher. Steam maintains control of the game, with online access required to validate the game before launching. They also offer an offline mode which requires online authentication every two weeks. This solution requires consumers to rely on Steam, with player access being unavailable if Steam is down. This system takes three primary solutions to anti-piracy: custom executable generation, retail encryption, and valuable platform-dependent features. Even with all these approaches, this system still does very little in preventing illegal copies of games emerging online. Hackers are able to release files to crack the Steam authentication, making all other safeguards obsolete.
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Although DRM is a widely adopted solution to a rampant problem, there are many arguments against it. Recently Microsoft shut down the Microsoft Store’s eBook section, revealing the harsh reality of DRM. Microsoft has already halted all eBook sales, and very soon will be removing all purchased books from the libraries of users. Microsoft will refund customers in full for what they paid, as well as offer $25 compensation if any annotations or markups were made. Unfortunately, for some users, this compensation isn’t enough.&nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3">We can also look to the launch of Assassin’s Creed: Origins, a game that has reportedly been hampered by aggressive DRM. Legitimate users of the game are experiencing CPU spikes, with the DRM negatively affecting performance. And with four forms of DRM protection included, there is significant cost to user convenience.
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Ultimately, it is clear that DRM doesn’t work. In an increasingly digital ecosystem, it has become near impossible to prevent piracy. And with all the issues surrounding DRM, is it doing more harm than good? Piracy cannot be stopped, and invasive DRM will only turn more consumers off a product. This idea is a sentiment shared by many companies such as CD Projekt Red and Ubisoft.&nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3">So what other measures can companies take to protect their work? Current legal protections exist under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the US and the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2018 in Australia. These protections are a step in the right direction but still fail to enforce any restrictions. 
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Maybe DRM will eventually offer perfect, seamless protection at no detriment to users. But until that happens, companies will have to settle the DRM argument themselves. Piracy won’t disappear anytime soon, and so perhaps it’s time for developers to make purchasing and owning games and other software easier. By incentivising purchases, companies can combat piracy on a systemic level.&nbsp;</span></p>
