                     <p class="p-3">Social media has become a pivotal part of our society, providing an outlet for communication and sharing. These websites and applications allow users to create and share content and participate in social networks. Some of the most notable social media platforms today include Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, each of these sites having more than 100 million users globally. These sites have become hubs for users to share personal information. With this new wealth of information available online comes a series of security risks. 
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>With these platforms, some of the main concerns to security involve personal information. These platforms operate on the sharing of content, mostly personal. With a society so focused on sharing, the amount of sensitive information being stored online is scary. This sensitive information can include personal information such as addresses and locations as well as private photos. The information available can put users in risk of both physical and digital attacks, as well as open up the possibilities of security attacks like phishing and ransomware. With all these risks, there is immense responsibility on these companies to ensure user data is protected. However, a lack of foresight and transparency has led to a plethora of scandals involving data breaches and security leaks. &nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3">One of the current leaders in the social media space is Facebook, a social networking platform established in 2004. Facebook currently has 2.38 billion active users monthly, with a net worth of $138 billion. Despite its immense presence in the industry, Facebook has consistently been involved in scandals surrounding privacy and data misuse.
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Last year, Facebook was involved in a massive scandal surrounding Cambridge Analytica and the 2016 Trump campaign. Cambridge Analytica is a political consulting firm which worked on the Trump campaign. At the core of the scandal is a data breach, in which Facebook exposed user data of up to 87 million users. This data was leaked from Facebook through a Facebook app in the form of a quiz. This app collected the data from people who took the quiz, but also exposed a loophole in the Facebook API that allowed it to collect data from Facebook friends of the quiz takers as well. This data was then sold by Cambridge Analytica, a move that is prohibited by Facebook. Although the impact this leak has on the 2016 presidential election is unknown, it brings to light some serious concerns around the trust users can place in Facebook.&nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3">This bug allowed hackers to steal access tokens, allowing them to log in to people’s accounts without a password. Unlike the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this breach is wholly the fault of Facebook. This flaw in their security demonstrates an incompetence and negligence on the part of Facebook, as well as a greater concern about user trust in Facebook.
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>A more recent security scandal occurred earlier this year, when Facebook admitted to exposing the passwords of hundreds of millions of users. During a security review in January, Facebook found that user passwords were being stored in a readable format within its internal data storage systems. These plaintext passwords had been searchable by Facebook employees in some cases since 2012. This security failure could have impacted between 200 million and 600 million users, with this information being available to 20,000 Facebook employees.&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>These examples are only a fraction of the scandals Facebook has been involved in regarding user data and security. Amidst these scandals emerges a growing discussion about social media companies and the responsibility they hold in protecting user data. In response to these growing leaks, users can protect themselves better on Facebook by turning on two-factor authentication and monitoring active logins, as well as by reviewing individual privacy settings.&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Ultimately, with large, complicated, older products like Facebook, errors are somewhat inevitable. Facebook has become a vital component of millions of people’s lives, leaving an immense responsibility on Facebook to protect its users. However, after countless scandals detailing data leaks and misuse of data, it is clear that Facebook aren’t capable of doing this. External oversight and intervention will be required to establish security standards surrounding the use and misuse of user data. Unless Facebook makes significant changes to company policies, governments and regulators will need to do more in moderating practices and establishing accountability.&nbsp;</span></p>
